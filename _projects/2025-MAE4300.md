# Accountability and Ethical Decision-Making in the Boeing 737 MAX Case

## Introduction
The Boeing 737 MAX crashes are often described as a technical failure, but the ethical failure was broader and harder to pinpoint. Decisions about design, documentation, training, certification, and organizational incentives combined put the public at risk. The central question is not only what failed, but who had decision and authority, what duties they owed, and how they should have acted when safety concerns surfaced, and ultimately what lead to the crash.

Central Thesis : The 737 MAX case shows that accountability in engineering must be active, not passive, and how ASME Canon 1 (safety of the public) must override scheduling, cost pressure, and employer loyalty when life is on the line, and transparent communication are part of “safety,” not optional extras.

## Relevant Facts

### Overall facts
- MCAS design contributed directly to the Lion Air and Ethiopian crashes.
- Lack of redundancy (single AoA sensor dependence) created a single-point-of-failure vulnerability.
- Optional/disabled alerting meant pilots could be unaware of error in sensor conditions.
- Pilot training and notification about MCAS were omitted/minimized, while documentation of the technology was scarse.
- Certification shortcuts helped the aircraft reach market faster, .

**Why these matter ethically:**

### Individual facts (people’s decisions/actions)
- Engineer concerns were raised early (single-sensor risk, lack of redundancy) but ignored/minimized.
- Test pilot warnings existed and should have triggered deeper review, but was quickly swept under the rug.
- FAA delegation/limited oversight shaped how risk was assessed.
- Maintenance/sensor issues (e.g., faulty input) fed into MCAS’s vulnerability.

### Organizational facts (policies/culture/incentives)
- Corporate pressure favored speed-to-market over conservative safety margins.
- Delegated authority culture blurred boundaries between regulator and manufacturer.
- Profit-driven training policy (no extra training) incentives shaped decisions, which led to pilots being unaware of the intricacies of the technology.
- Internal communication breakdown reflected a culture that discouraged engineerings from speaking up against the safety risks.
- Boeing's post-crash response deepened mistrust and led to worldwide grounding of MCAS.

## Definitional Clarification
Before we can judge what Boeing, engineers, or the FAA *should* have done, we have to clarify what key ethical terms mean in this case. The 737 MAX controversy isn’t only about facts, it’s also about which definition of “safety” and “accountability” is being used. Boeing can appear “in the right” if safety is defined as "meeting minimum regulatory requirements," but the same actions look unethical if safety is defined as "preventing foreseeable catastrophic risk". I’m using this section to make those definitions explicit so that, in the next sections, I can justify which definition should control.

### Safety (as defined by the entity)
- **Boeing:** regulatory compliance.
- **Victims’ families:** prevention of foreseeable catastrophic risk.
- **FAA:** federal airworthiness standards.

**So what?** If safety = compliance, Boeing looks defensible. If safety = risk prevention, minimizing redundancy/training looks negligent.

### Accountability (as defined by the entity)
- **Boeing:** cooperation with investigations.
- **Victims’ families:** public acknowledgement of wrongdoing.
- **FAA:** ensuring manufacturer + agency uphold oversight.

### Integrity / Responsibility (as defined by the entity)
- Integrity as “image” vs integrity as “truthfulness even when profits hurt.”
- Responsibility as “following procedure” vs responsibility as “preventing foreseeable harm.”
- Morality as “legal compliance” vs “human-centered protection of life.”

These definitional differences explain why Boeing could argue “we complied,” while the public sees it as an ethical failure on Boeing's part.

## Ethical Analysis of Five Core Issues

### Issue 1 — Cost/Schedule vs Testing & Validation
**Issue statement:** Should Boeing have rushed testing/validation due to cost/timeline pressure to compete?

- **Stakeholders:** passengers, pilots, airlines, Boeing engineers/management, regulators.
- **Relevant canons:** Canon 1 (public safety), Canon 2 (competence), Canon 4 (faithful agent).
- **Conflict:** business pressure and deadlines vs conservative validation standards.
- **Hierarchy decision:** Canon 1 overrides Canon 4 in life-critical systems.
- **Resolution:** Rushing validation to meet market pressure is ethically wrong because it increases foreseeable risk, to minimize timeline.

### Issue 2 — Documentation / Transparency about MCAS 
**Issue statement:** Should Boeing engineers have approved MCAS while providing incomplete/misleading documentation to regulators and/or leaving details out of public-facing materials?

- **Stakeholders:** FAA regulators, pilots, passengers, airlines, Boeing.
- **Relevant canons:** Canon 1, Canon 2, Canon 7 (truthful communication).
- **Conflict:** confidentiality/“company secrets” and schedule vs truthful disclosure needed for safety.
- **Hierarchy decision:** Canon 7 supports Canon 1—misleading docs create safety risk.
- **Resolution:** Withholding safety-critical system behavior violates Canon 7 and contributes to violating Canon 1.

### Issue 3 — Pilot Training vs Cost/Schedule
**Issue statement:** Should Boeing have prioritized pilot training over schedule/cost for MCAS?

- **Stakeholders:** pilots/passengers (primary), airlines/regulators (secondary), Boeing (decision-maker)
- **Relevant canons:** Canon 1, Canon 2
- **Conflict:** “no new training” business incentive vs operational preparedness.
- **Hierarchy decision:** Canon 1 overrides corporate competitiveness.
- **Resolution:** Minimizing training to accelerate production/reduce cost is ethically unacceptable in a life-critical system.

### Issue 4 — Regulatory Oversight & Accepting Boeing Internal Testing
**Issue statement:** Should FAA regulators have accepted Boeing internal testing/data without independent testing?

- **Stakeholders:** passengers, pilots, airline operators, FAA employees, Boeing management.
- **Relevant canons:** Canon 1, Canon 2, Canon 7
- **Conflict:** limited FAA expertise/resources and timeline pressure vs independent verification duty.
- **Hierarchy decision:** Canon 1 demands independent verification or third-party validation when stakes are catastrophic.
- **Resolution:** Reliance on manufacturer testing alone is ethically wrong when it reduces meaningful oversight.

### Issue 5 — Internal Objections / Whistleblowing
**Issue statement:** Should Boeing engineers have raised internal objections or whistleblown when safety concerns about MCAS were ignored?

- **Stakeholders:** passengers (primary), families of victims/FAA (secondary), engineers (at-risk).
- **Relevant canons:** Canon 1 vs Canon 4; Canon 7
- **Conflict:** job security and organizational retaliation vs duty to protect the public.
- **Hierarchy decision:** Canon 1 is paramount; employer loyalty cannot outrank public safety.
- **Resolution:** Engineers had an ethical duty to escalate concerns; failure to do so contributed to harm.

## Practical Constraints: Why the Ideal Ethical Action Didn’t Happen
A realistic ethics analysis must acknowledge constraints without excusing outcomes:

- **Job security/retaliation:** engineers risk firing, reputation loss, and financial instability if they challenge leadership.
- **Information silos:** subsystem engineers may not see the full system-level risk.
- **Escalation friction:** whistleblowing channels may exist but reports can be discouraged or fail to reach effective action.
- **Business/timeline pressure:** shareholder and competition pressure to ship ASAP; training could delay rollout by months.
- **Stakeholder resistance:** pilots/airlines may resist extra training requirements.
- **Regulatory limitations:** FAA may lack in-house capacity to retest; trust in a “reputable” company can become complacency.
- **Hierarchy:** higher-ups may lock in design decisions (like single-sensor dependence), limiting ground-level engineer influence.

**Link sentence:** These constraints explain *how* the failure persisted, but they do not overturn Canon 1’s ethical priority.

## Preventing Repeat Failures: Individual, Organizational, Systemic

### Individual level
- Stronger ethics training focused on recognizing Canon 1 > Canon 4 conflicts.
- Documentation discipline training: thorough safety documentation for life-protecting systems.
- Encourage engineers to treat “don’t cut corners” as a priority, not a suggestion.

### Organizational level (Boeing)
- Culture that encourages dissent and “freedom to speak” without retaliation.
- Transparent regulator communication norms; don’t hide safety-critical details as “company secrets.”
- Internal safety review boards with authority to slow/stop certification when risk is credible.

### Systemic level (FAA/industry)
- Require independent validation of safety-critical systems (or third-party testing) instead of unilateral trust.
- FAA must thoroughly vet documentation for new systems and require meaningful verification.
- Industry-wide standards: new flight systems trigger standardized pilot training requirements.

## Conclusion
The 737 MAX case illustrates how ethical failure can come from a chain of “reasonable” business and procedural decisions that, together, violate the profession’s most basic duty. Like as my middle school gym teacher would say "if you keep cutting corners, you will end up a mile behind," a sequence of cutting corners and undermining ethical responsibility led to the catastrophy. Under ASME ethics, the hierarchy is clear: **public safety is paramount**, and transparency, training, and independent verification are not optional, they are part of what safety means. Accountability requires designing for foreseeable failure, communicating truthfully, empowering dissent, and ensuring oversight is real rather than symbolic.
