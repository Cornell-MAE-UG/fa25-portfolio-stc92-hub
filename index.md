## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am good at math. 

That is my short synopsis, but I am current a senior at Cornell Engineering, studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in aerospace. In the upcoming spring semester I will be starting my Masters in Aerospace Engineering at Cornell. Personally I concentrate in a subject called rigit body dynamics, which is the overall study of how things move in 3D space, including translational and rotational motion.

My passion for engineering started in elementary school when little Sally went to go see the critically acclaimed Iron Man. This didn't just show me at a young age what it means to be a hero, but also how a kid like me can one day help others using math, the one subject I was capable in at the time. Extrapolating that message across the decades, it has and will always be my mission to help others using engineering. That mission brings me to today, where I study everything and anything, so I can to one day help humanity reach the stars.

Now, I am the lead of my project team, Cornell Hyperloop, where I research and implement controls engineering to achieve electromagnetic levitation. I started on the team in freshman year, where I was a member of the magnetic braking team, but always had a desire to start working on the bleeding-edge of research of levitation, where little to no research has been developed. Over the years I rose through the ranks to be where I am now, the mechanical lead, both doing my research into magnetic levitation, while assisting the other subteams (magnetic and pneumatic braking, magnetic propulsion, and aeroshell manufacturing) in their endevors.
