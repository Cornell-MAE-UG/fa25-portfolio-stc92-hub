## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am good at math. 

That is my short synopsis, but moreover I am currently a senior in Cornell Engineering, studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in aerospace. In the upcoming spring semester, I will be starting my Master’s in Aerospace Engineering at Cornell. My primary academic focus is rigid body dynamics, which is the study of how objects move in three-dimensional space, including both translational and rotational motion, along with aerodynamic design.

My passion for engineering started in elementary school when little Sally went to go see the critically acclaimed *Iron Man*. This didn't just show me at a young age what it means to be a hero, but also how a kid like me can one day help others using math, the one subject I was capable in at the time. Extrapolating that message across the decades, it has and will always be my mission to help others using engineering. That mission brings me to today, where I study everything and anything, so I can to one day help humanity reach the stars.

Now, I serve as a lead on my project team, Cornell Hyperloop, where I research and implement controls engineering to achieve electromagnetic levitation. I joined the team during my freshman year as a member of the magnetic braking subteam, but I always had a desire to work on the bleeding edge of levitation research — an area where little prior work exists. Over the years, I rose through the ranks to my current role as Mechanical Lead, conducting my own research into magnetic levitation while also supporting other subteams, including magnetic and pneumatic braking, magnetic propulsion, and aeroshell manufacturing.

In my spare time I am also the lead engineer for a startup. Go2 (Co2Go), is a startup business that is currently designing and starting the manufacturing process for a new brand of beverage devices, that automatically carbonates your drinks. I have done all the engineering work for this team, which is comprised of building prototyping, designing the device in CAD, 3D printing multiple models for investor events, and build part drawing which I send out to manufacturers overseas to build our patent-pending Co2 canister design.
